Feature Engineering 
What is feature engineering?
All machine learning algorithms use some input data to generate outputs. Input data contains many features which may not be in proper form to be given to the model directly. It needs some kind of processing and here feature engineering helps. Feature engineering fulfils mainly two goals:

It prepares the input dataset in the form which is required for a specific model or machine learning algorithm.
Feature engineering helps in improving the performance of machine learning models magically
